# ECC-Encryption-System
This is a Verilog algorithm which takes 8bits and encrypts the data for the purpose of secure communication based on the concept of Elliptic Curve Cryptography. This project was implemented using a spartan 3 FPGA kit.

## TODO

* Create a block Diagram
* Implementing a wrapper to be compatible with axi4 full protocol
* Porting to other platforms (e.g. 7 series)
* Developing tcl script to pack the ip
* Developing designs with the pcie xdma interface and with Uart interface
